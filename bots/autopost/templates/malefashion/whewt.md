Street snaps, look books, advertisements -- anything goes. No self-shots, please.

This can be a space for any kind of inspirational stuff. Pics of deserts, army dudes in camo from Associated Press pics, maybe a pattern you saw on the wall. Whatever.

Include a blurb describing why you find it inspiring.

If you're posting a creep shot, please obscure your subject's face.
