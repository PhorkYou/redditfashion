Do you have a new clothing item you don't know how to wear? No idea what to wear to a wedding/interview/date? Unsure how to accessorize an outfit? Then your questions belong here! Post below to receive advice and feedback.

When posting:

* Include what the attire is for (work, school, going out, etc.)

* If possible, take a front-on, full-body picture as this gives the best impression of how the clothes fit. Multiple pictures from different angles can also be helpful, but those aren't necessary.

* Critiquing others is welcome and encouraged, but keep it constructive/factual. Take a lesson from Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People if needed. It takes balls to post pictures of yourself on the Internet, the least you can do is accord the same courtesy as you would to someone in real life.

* Reddit Enhancement Suite makes it very easy to view pictures in a thread.

* Some users enjoy knowing where you bought your pieces, please consider including those in your post!

Feel free to also submit your outfit to the biweekly WAYWT thread, but know that these two threads have different purposes. **This is explicitly for feedback and questions, though you may receive constructive criticism in either thread.**
