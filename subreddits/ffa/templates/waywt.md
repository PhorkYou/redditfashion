WAYWT is the acronym for "What Are You Wearing Today". It doesn't necessarily need to be what you were wearing TODAY.

* Post as often as you like, but edit your first post with pictures

* Include what the attire is for (work, school, home)

* Pictures are incredibly encouraged as it's quite tough to imagine what someone else is wearing without them.

* Critiquing others is welcome and encouraged, but keep it constructive/factual. Take a lesson from Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People if needed. It takes balls to post pictures of yourself on the Internet, the least you can do is accord the same courtesy as you would to someone in real life.

* Please do not downvote for not agreeing with someone's opinion.

* Reddit Enhancement Suite makes it very easy to view pictures in a thread.

We highly recommend using [dressed.so](http://www.dressed.so) (built by MFAer /u/n1c!) to collect your looks if you're a frequent WAYWT poster! You can conveniently tag different items you're wearing.
