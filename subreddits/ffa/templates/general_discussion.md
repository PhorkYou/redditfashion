In this thread, you can talk about whatever the hell you want. Talk about style, ask questions, talk about life, do whatever. Vent. Meet the community. It will be like IRC (except missing a very important robot).

If you're new to the community, please don't be shy! Say hello and introduce yourself. And if you've been here for a while, welcome our newer subscribers into the fold. =)

Note: Comment rules still apply, don't be a dick.
