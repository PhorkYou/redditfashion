An alternative to our weekly "should or shouldn't I buy" in which posters are encouraged to post items they want, need, or love. For instance:


* I really want black pants for the office.


* I would like to find shorts that work for daytime and going out but don't make me look like I'm headed to a frat party.


* I wish I won the lottery so I could buy these shoes.


Feel free to post about items you are considering purchasing, items you wish you could afford, or hypothetical items you wish you could track down.
