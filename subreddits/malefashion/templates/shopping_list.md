Post what's on your "to acquire" list. This can run the gamut from something you hope to get once your record deal goes through, to something nice you're saving up a few months for, to basic items you're picking up this weekend.

You can also share recently purchased pieces.

Alternatively, post items from ebay/yoox/forum marketplaces that you had to pass on. Maybe it wasn't your size, maybe you don't have the funds right now, either way: someone should buy it.

Shopping List, is a more diversified post which includes but not limited to:

* finding cheaper or similar alternatives to products within reason.
* Cop or Not
* Recent and Future purchases
* someone should buy this
